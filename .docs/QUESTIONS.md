# questions

* is there a better way to handle actions in an array? see [bindIndexToActionCreator](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/05/19/redux-reducer-arrays.html)
* how to load content from an url change? I'm using componentWillMount, but is there a way to do this even before that?
* actions for every button or manage a bigger slice of the state and update it at once?
